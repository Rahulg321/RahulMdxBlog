## What does great developer marketing look like?

I‚Äôm a developer who [works](/work) at the intersection of engineering, product, and marketing. Based on my experience, the best developer marketing:

1. **Teaches how to build great products**
2. **Builds and retains trust**
3. **Uses precise language**

### How did they build that!?

When I see a great developer tool, my first thought is: **how did they build that?**

There‚Äôs a natural curiosity. I want to reverse engineer the product and [learn new tools](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-next-js-commerce-2-0) or skills I can apply to my work.

The best developer marketing shows how to build great product experiences. Bonus points if you capture the ‚Äúcurrent thing‚Äù ‚Äì a new AI tool, or a popular style of app (TikTok clone).

Great developer marketing is invoking this response as a service.

### Zero days since the latest JavaScript framework

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, the debate between dynamic and static typing continues to be a hot topic. While dynamic typing offers flexibility and rapid development, static typing brings its own set of powerful advantages that can significantly improve the quality and maintainability of code. In this post, we'll explore why static typing is crucial for developers, accompanied by practical examples through markdown code snippets.

## Improved Code Quality and Safety

One of the most compelling reasons to use static typing is the improvement it brings to code quality and safety. By enforcing type checks at compile time, static typing catches errors early in the development process, reducing the chances of runtime errors.

```js
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

function getMDXFiles(dir) {
  return fs.readdirSync(dir).filter((file) => path.extname(file) === ".mdx");
}

function readMDXFile(filePath) {
  let rawContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf-8");
  return parseFrontmatter(rawContent);
}

function getMDXData(dir) {
  let mdxFiles = getMDXFiles(dir);
  return mdxFiles.map((file) => {
    let { metadata, content } = readMDXFile(path.join(dir, file));
    let slug = path.basename(file, path.extname(file));
    return {
      metadata,
      slug,
      content,
    };
  });
}

export function getBlogPosts() {
  return getMDXData(path.join(process.cwd(), "content"));
}
```

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// This will throw an error at compile time, preventing potential runtime issues.
let message: string = greet(123);
```

## Enhanced Readability and Maintainability

Static typing makes code more readable and maintainable. By explicitly declaring types, developers provide a clear contract of what the code does, making it easier for others (or themselves in the future) to understand and modify the codebase.

## Facilitates Tooling and Refactoring

Modern IDEs leverage static typing to offer advanced features like code completion, refactoring, and static analysis. These tools can automatically detect issues, suggest fixes, and safely refactor code, enhancing developer productivity and reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs during refactoring.

```csharp
// Refactoring example: Renaming a method in C#
public class Calculator {
    public int Add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// After refactoring `Add` to `Sum`, all references are automatically updated.
public class Calculator {
    public int Sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

Static typing can lead to better performance. Since types are known at compile time, compilers can optimize the generated code more effectively. This can result in faster execution times and lower resource consumption.

## Conclusion

Static typing offers numerous benefits that contribute to the development of robust, efficient, and maintainable software. By catching errors early, enhancing readability, facilitating tooling, and enabling optimizations, static typing is an invaluable asset for developers. As the software industry continues to mature, the importance of static typing in ensuring code quality and performance cannot be overstated. Whether you're working on a large-scale enterprise application or a small project, embracing static typing can lead to better software development outcomes.
