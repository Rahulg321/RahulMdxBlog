Whenever I try to answer the question "Who are you?", I always find myself coming back to a scene from _Kung Fu Panda 3_, where Po battles Kai. In that moment, Kai asks Po, “Who are you?” and Po responds, “I have been asking myself the same question. Am I the son of a panda or a goose? A student or a teacher? It turns out I am all of those things.”

This truly resonates with me. Whenever someone asks who I am, this is the answer I give. Like Po from Kung Fu Panda, I’ve realized that I don’t fit into just one role or identity.

I am a developer and a badminton player, a learner and a teacher, a reader and a gamer. These roles are all part of me, and together they make me whole.

## A Life of Experiences

In life, you are going to be many things. From a kid to an adult, you will assume many roles in life. My goal is to be the best version of myself in each of these roles and perform my duties accordingly.

When someone asks me, "What is the meaning of life to you?" or "What is a good life to you?", my answer is simple:

> _I crave a life of experiences._

I want my life to be filled with _memorable events_. I want to know:

- What it feels like to _win_.
- How it feels to _create something from scratch_.
- What it’s like to _walk through the streets of New York City_.
- How it feels to _be in the best shape of my life_.
- What it’s like to _compete inside a crowded arena_
- What it’s like to _attend the Olympic Games_.
- What it feels like to _see the Northern Lights_.

That is what life is to me — _a collection of meaningful experiences_. And I believe anyone can pursue and embrace all of these moments in their lifetime as long as they do their _own thing_ and not what society wants them to.

I don't whether these experiences are good or bad. Because the simple truth is this...

> A man cannot go through life whether things happening to me.

For the remainder of this blog I want to talk all the things that I have been a big part of my life, my past experiences and my pursuits for the future...

## Being a Developer

Becoming a developer has completely transformed my perspective on life. Growing up, I used to believe that people were meant to excel in only one area. Whether you were a businessman, a policeman, or a teacher, that was your role, and there was no deviation from it. To become proficient in these roles, you had to attend traditional institutions, get admission, follow a structured course, and that's how you built your career.

But that mindset changed drastically when I stepped into the world of software development. This field showed me that it's possible to carve your own path, to explore and experiment without the need for rigid, formal education. I had to figure out so much on my own—navigating through various technologies, learning from different sources, and constantly improving.

I realized that _anything can be learned and achieved_, often without the need for traditional institutions. In software engineering, you can learn almost anything on your own and still make significant progress. Of course, there are exceptions, but you can definitely learn enough to gain a competitive edge.

My philosophy now is this:

> Even if I don’t know something, I can teach myself and figure it out as I go.

It may take time and a lot of trial and error, but I know I can always take the first step without hesitation. And that confidence is what keeps me pushing forward.

You can just do stuff!!

Every software developer has felt this at some point. The moment we learn something new—whether it's a programming language, technology, database, framework, or architecture—and build something with it, we realize that limits are just illusions. There are truly no limits to what you can achieve or create; there is no need to specialize and focus on just one thing.

You don't find the right job for the tool; you find the right tools for the job and go from there.

One thing I will say, though, is that I don't know what the future holds. But one thing I am sure of is that no matter where I go—whether I take a job at a company or work fully in my own business—I will continue to learn, innovate, and create. I won't limit myself to a single niche; I'll always strive for knowledge, learning, and building.

## Badminton

<StaticTweet id="1698275115807719479" />

Badminton has been an integral part of my life for as long as I can remember. Although I may not play as frequently now, it was a defining element of my upbringing, and it continues to hold significant meaning for me. When I was on the court, it felt as though time stood still—hours would pass unnoticed as I became fully immersed in the flow of the game. On some weekends, we would spend the entire day playing, captivated by the crisp sound of the shuttle striking the racket. Those moments were pure bliss.

I believe that everyone should have a sport or activity that serves as their sanctuary—a place where they can unwind, live fully, and be present in the moment. Even on my worst days, if I had the chance to play a competitive game of badminton with my friends in the evening, it transformed the day into one that felt meaningful and fulfilling. The experience turned even the most challenging days into ones that I could still consider well spent.

For me, badminton has always been more than just a sport—it has been my refuge, my anchor. I hope everyone finds something similar—a space where they can be fully engaged, challenge themselves, and derive joy from the simplest of moments.

I have played badminton both professionally and as a hobby, and they are completely different experiences. When competing for a title, the sport becomes far more serious and intense. I still remember my first tournament—during my match, there were no other games in the hall, so all the crowd's attention was on me. It was exhilarating. My legs were shaking between points, and the crowd's energy was electric. The match lasted over 30 minutes and went to three games. Even though I lost, it was an unforgettable experience that I still cherish.

Even though I couldn't become a professional badminton player and compete internationally, I still plan to contribute to the sport as a developer, engineer, and businessman. Badminton has come a long way, but it is still far behind sports like cricket, football, and tennis in terms of money and popularity. No men's singles badminton player has ever made it to the Forbes list of highest-paid athletes, and many players struggle financially even after competing in the Olympics. This is disappointing, especially for such a challenging sport with a short career span due to its intense physical demands.

I plan to help increase the sport's popularity, improve player visibility, and create more financial opportunities.

## Books

> READING IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO COMBAT ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION

I read my first novel when I was in 10th grade. It was The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. The story, centered on pursuing one's dreams no matter the cost, deeply moved me. It was a simple yet powerful read that captivated me from start to finish, so much so that I read it in a single sitting.

I was profoundly impressed by the author and his ability to convey complex thoughts in such simple language. I went on to read more of Paulo's books, like The Zahir, The Witch of Portobello, Adultery, and Hippie. Each of these novels was easy to read yet carried a profound message.

After my fiction phase, I transitioned to reading self-help books, largely because they were trending and popular on social media. One of the first books I read during this stage was The 5 AM Club by Robin Sharma. I then read Atomic Habits, How to Win Friends and Influence People, and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Among all of these, the most impactful was The Almanack of Naval Ravikant. There is something about this book that resonates deeply with me. The way Naval explains life, business, health, and diet is truly insightful. If I were to memorize one book, it would be this one.

Currently, I am in my George R.R. Martin phase, exploring his fantasy and science fiction works. George is truly one of a kind—his writing and the world he has created are legendary. He writes evil characters, good characters, but most importantly, he writes gray characters—those that blur the line between good and bad. Martin once said:

> We all have the ability to do good or bad when presented with the appropriate circumstances.

<FullScreenImageComponent

/>

A prime example of this complexity is Jaime Lannister from A Song of Ice and Fire. Both in the books and the show, he stands out as one of the most intricate characters I have encountered. Jaime is a morally gray character, constantly torn between love and duty. At times, he chooses duty; at other times, love prevails. His true turning point comes when he loses his hand—his very identity. Having spent his entire life becoming an unmatched swordsman, he suddenly loses the one thing that defined him.

To all my readers, I ask: How would you feel if you lost the one thing that defined you and had to start all over again? How would a runner feel if they suddenly lost their legs? How would an artist feel if they could no longer create?

Reflecting on these questions helps us understand resilience and the fluid nature of identity. Our identities are not fixed; they change with every moment and every choice we make. Who you choose to be now is who you are.

Books have played a significant role in shaping who I am today. They have been my companions, my teachers, and my inspiration. From the fiction that sparked my imagination to the self-help books that guided my growth, and now to the rich, complex worlds of George R.R. Martin, reading has and will always be an incredible journey.

I hope my experiences inspire you to pick up a book, explore new worlds, and maybe even redefine what you think is the truth.

## Looking Ahead

Life is a journey filled with opportunities to learn, grow, and create. Whether it's through my work as a developer or my passion for adventure, I strive to keep pushing boundaries, seeking new experiences, and challenging myself to uncover deeper truths. My story is still being written, and I eagerly anticipate both the challenges and the joys that lie ahead.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Until next time—keep exploring, keep learning, and stay curious.
